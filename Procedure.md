###Checking type and amount of oil needed
 - Refer to your owners manual to determine the amount of oil that your engine occupies. This information usually located in the "Maitenence" section of the manual. 

###Gather materials and tools
 - Gathering your tools and materials can help minimize the time it takes to perform your oil change and also help when you are under the vehicle. 

###Prepare your vehicle 
 - Make sure vehicle and oil are warm, not hot or ice cold usually waiting an hour after driving vehicle will suffice. Place jack at the jack point under your vehicle.(refer to manual if you are not familiar with jack points) Once jack is securely placed on jack point lift vehicle. 

###Locate Drain Plug and Oil Filter
 - Once vehicle is securely lifted lay on your back below the vehicle and locate your drain plug. Place drain pan below drain plug and use tools to slowly remove drain plug.
 - Oil filters are usually located under the hood in a plastic casing. In certain models the filter can be located below the vehicle. Reffer to owners manual for filter location.   

###Drain the oil 
 - As oil begins to drain carefully slide out from below vehicle. Allow all of oil to drain out. If oil flow is very slow removing the oil cap under the hood can help speed up the proccess. 

###Replace Drain Plug
 - Once the oil flow slows to a drop every few seconds or completely stops carefully slide your body back under vehicle and replace the drain plug. Be careful not to overtighten as this can damage the drain plug threads. 

###Change the oil filter
 - Having located your oil filter, remove the cover of the casing and carefully remove the old filter. Carefully pour a small amount of fresh oil over new filter. Place new filter in casing and screw on until snug. Replace and casing cover is applicable. 
 - Slowly lower your vehicle and remove jack from under the vehicle.

###Adding Fresh Oil
 - Once your filter and drin plug have been replaced remove the oil cap under the hood if you haven't already and use funnel to help pour fresh oil into engine. After all necessary oil has been added replace oil cap.

###Check oil levels
 - Use oil dip stick to make sure your oil levels are an acceptable level. Recommend to check 2-3 times to assure an accurate measurement. 

###Start engine and check for any leaks
 - Once oil levels are at acceptable start your engine and examine under the hood and below your vehicle for any leaks. If any leaks are present immediately turn of vehicle and address where the leak is.
